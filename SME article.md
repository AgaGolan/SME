A technical writer’s job is not about sitting still by your desk and doing your stuff patiently. During your work, you’ll need to contact various types of people to get the content you need and solve problems you’ll meet. The crucial person in this process is SME.

>**A subject-matter expert (SME)** is a person who has accumulated great knowledge in a particular field or topic and this level of knowledge is demonstrated by the person's degree, licensure, and/or through years of professional experience with the subject.

So, SMEs possess the information you need to move on with your work. As highly technical people, they can (but don’t have to) be a little awkward, introverted, or simply not that into social communication. But, when you are a technical writer, there is no way to avoid them, no matter how hard a touch with them can be.

In this article, you can find a piece of advice on how to handle them when they don’t have time or will to cooperate with you.

# Infiltrate
Before you bring your SME a tone of questions, first try to get to know something more about this person. Of course, I don't mean digging deep into their personal life. Talk to your team and ask about your SMEs - they probably can tell you more about them. Try to find out what kind of person they are, what they like, how to reach them etc. Then, you can use it while the introduction - for example, treat them with self-made chocolate cookies when you encounter a chocolate lover. Maybe you will find that you and your SME have something in common. Sharing a hobby with someone is always an excellent start to an acquaintance! 

# The Power of Impression
*Fine feathers make fine birds.* Your impression of people significantly impacts your cooperation, whether you like it or not. So, make your SME know you. Keep communicating with them (check which way they prefer - face-to-face, e-mail, chat, etc.). Take part in every possible meeting concerning your project. Also, be prepared to inform SMEs and ask the right questions. Try to show yourself as a confident, task-oriented person who knows what they are doing. Know your value and don't be afraid to show it.

# You Scratch My Back and I'll Scratch Yours
It can be hard when you're a beginner in this job or this company, but if you have a chance to do your SME a favor, do it. It can be proofreading their texts, helping with reports, or *fixing the software through documentation*. When you help them once, they'll remember you and be more eager to help you when needed.

# Don't Waste Their Time
Picking up the meeting in SME's calendar seems like a good idea, but that's not all. When you schedule an appointment with your SME, ensure it won't be a waste of time for you and them. Be well prepared - try to gather as much information about the product as possible. Also, let your SME prepare well - put some bullet points you want to discuss into the invitation you send. It's also good to estimate how long the meeting should last - you'll show your SME that you respect their time. When you don't understand something, ask for clarification. 

Also, try to ease the conversation - don't make it an interview; talk to each other.

# Escalate?
An unresponsive SME may be blocking you with your tasks. You keep bugging them and try various ways of contact, but nothing really happens. If you feel you can do nothing more with it, it's time to ask for help. Of course, consider the organization's policy and find the right person to help you - usually your direct leader or project manager. It might not be friendly, but escalating shows your leader and SME that the matter is severe, you care for it, and you can't wait for weeks for their response.

# Time to Move on
Sometimes, you find a hard person to cooperate with, and you struggle whenever you need help from them. Sometimes, it's a matter of the management or the company. Nevertheless, if you feel that this cooperation is a struggle, nothing gets better in time, or escalations don't work properly, maybe it's time to give up. Perhaps the best you can do in this situation is to consider whether you are well-appreciated in this company and if you still want to work here. None of us can match every environment; maybe this one is not good for you. Sounds familiar? Spread your wings and move on; you can find a job where you’ll be valued as a specialist.

I hope this text gave you some tips when encountering an unresponsive, extremely busy, or dismissive SME. Let me know in the comment section.
